Real-time Go struct to JS object synchronisation over SSE and WebSockets

:warning: *This is beta software. Be wary of using this in production. Please report any [issues](https://github.com/jpillora/velox/issues) you encounter.*

### Features

* Simple API
* Synchronise any JSON marshallable struct
* Delta updates using [JSONPatch (RFC6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
* Supports [Server-Sent Events (EventSource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
* SSE [client-side poly-fill](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js) to fallback to long-polling in older browsers (IE8+).
* Implement delta queries (return all results, then incrementally return changes)

### Quick Usage

Server

``` go
//syncable struct
type Foo struct {
	velox.State
	A, B int
}
foo := &Foo{}
//serve velox.js client library (assets/dist/velox.min.js)
http.Handle("/velox.js", velox.JS)
//serve velox sync endpoint for foo
http.Handle("/sync", velox.SyncHandler(foo))
//make changes
foo.A = 42
foo.B = 21
//push to client
foo.Push()
```

Client

``` js
// load script /velox.js
var foo = {};
var v = velox("/sync", foo); //uses websockets if supported, otherwise, use sse
v.onupdate = function() {
	//foo.A === 42 and foo.B === 21
};
```

### API

Server API

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox)

Client API

* `velox(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new auto-detect velox connection
* `velox.sse(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new SSE velox connection
* `velox.ws(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new WS velox connection
* `v.onupdate(object)` *function* - Called when a server push is received
* `v.onerror(err)` *function* - Called when a connection error occurs
* `v.onconnect()` *function* - Called when the connection is opened
* `v.ondisconnect()` *function* - Called when the connection is closed
* `v.onchange(bool)` *function* - Called when the connection is opened or closed
* `v.connected` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is currently open
* `v.ws` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is in web sockets mode
* `v.sse` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is in server-sent events mode

*Here is a screenshot from this example page, showing the messages arriving as either a full replacement of the object or just a delta. The server will send which ever is smaller.*

### Notes

* JS object properties beginning with `$` will be ignored to play nice with Angular.
* JS object with an `$apply` function will automatically be called on each update to play nice with Angular.
* `velox.SyncHandler` is just a small wrapper around `velox.Sync`:

	```go
	func SyncHandler(gostruct interface{}) http.Handler {
		return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			if conn, err := Sync(gostruct, w, r); err == nil {
				conn.Wait()
			}
		})
	}
	```

### Known issues

* Object synchronization is currently one way (server to client) only.
* Object diff has not been optimized. It is a simple property-by-property comparison. :warning: Performance testing has not been done yet.

### TODO

* WebRTC support
