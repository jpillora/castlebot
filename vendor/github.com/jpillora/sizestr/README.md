### Usage

```
go get github.com/jpillora/sizestr
```

``` go
//use directly
sizestr.ToString(231938) //"232KB"
sizestr.Parse("232KB") //232000
sizestr.Parse("232KiB") //237568
//use with pkg/flag
var b sizestr.Bytes
flag.Var(&b, "size", "the size of my file")
```

#### Significant Figures

Default is `3`. Set via:

``` go
sizestr.ToStringSig(231938, 4) //"231.9KB"
```

#### Scale

Default is `1000`, standard units dictates that Kilo is 1000, not 1024. Also, see this [blog post](https://blogs.gnome.org/cneumair/2008/09/30/1-kb-1024-bytes-no-1-kb-1000-bytes/). Though can set via:

``` go
sizestr.ToStringSig(231938, 4, 1024) //"226.5KB"
```

---

#### `ToPrecision`

This library also contains a Go implementation of JavaScript's `Number.prototype.toPrecision`

``` go
sizestr.ToPrecision(123.456, 4) //123.5
```
